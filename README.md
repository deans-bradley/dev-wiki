# DevWiki

A comprehensive collection of development documentation, guides, and theoretical resources organized for easy reference and learning.

## Structure

### Development
Hands-on implementation guides and practical resources for building software.

#### Frontend
- **Web**: Vue.js, React, vanilla JavaScript
- **Mobile**: Flutter, React Native, native development
- **Desktop**: Electron, MAUI, Tauri
- **Patterns**: Frontend-specific design patterns and best practices

#### Backend
- **.NET**: Runtime libraries, dependency injection, and framework guides
- **Database**: SQL queries, Redis setup, database patterns
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, hosting, and infrastructure as code
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and service architecture

#### Shared
Cross-cutting concerns that span both frontend and backend:
- **Authentication**: Token management, OAuth flows, security practices
- **API Integration**: Client-server communication patterns
- **Data Contracts**: API schemas, data validation
- **Testing Strategies**: Integration testing, mocking, test automation

#### Security
- **Web Security**: XSS, CSRF, content security policies
- **API Security**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting
- **Mobile Security**: Platform-specific security considerations

#### Workflows
Development process and tooling:
- **Git**: Commands, branching strategies, collaboration workflows
- **CI/CD**: Build pipelines, deployment automation
- **Tools**: Development environment setup, productivity tools

### Theory
Foundational concepts and principles for software development.

#### Software Engineering
- **Design Patterns**: Common software design patterns and their applications
- **Architecture Principles**: Clean architecture, SOLID principles, domain-driven design
- **Clean Code**: Code quality, refactoring, maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling, caching strategies, optimization techniques

#### Project Management
- **Agile Methodologies**: Scrum, Kanban, lean development
- **Estimation Techniques**: Story points, planning poker, velocity tracking
- **Team Collaboration**: Communication strategies, code reviews, documentation

#### Fundamentals
- **Networking**: Network protocols, troubleshooting, connectivity testing
- **Databases**: Database design theory, normalization, indexing strategies
- **Security Principles**: Cryptography, threat modeling, security architecture
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Computational complexity, optimization

## Getting Started

1. Browse the relevant section based on your current needs
2. Check the `development/workflows/` section for setup guides
3. Refer to `theory/` sections for a deeper understanding of concepts
4. Use the search functionality to find specific topics

## Contributing

This documentation is continuously evolving. When adding new content:

1. Follow the established structure and naming conventions
2. Place implementation guides in `development/`
3. Place conceptual content in `theory/`
4. Cross-reference related documents when applicable
5. Keep examples practical and up-to-date

## Migration Status

This repository is currently being restructured. Some content may still be in the process of being moved to the new organization system.

**Current Status**: Foundation established, content migration in progress
